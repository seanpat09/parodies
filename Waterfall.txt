Waterfall
(to the tune of 'Waterfalls' by TLC)

A lonely dev opens up a new window
Staring at features she just can't touch
If at any time the project needs new iterations
The PM doesn't realize he hurts her so much

But all the planning was done months ago
Because the client was too worried for trouble
So he goes and implements design the best way he knows how
Another user feedback unheard from
Listen to me 

Don't go practicing Waterfall
Please stick to the releases and the sprints that you're used to
I know you're gonna build the app your way or not at all
But I think we're moving too slow

/ Little precious has a natural obsession
/ For temptation but he just can't see
/ She gives him loving that his body can't handle
/ But all he can say is "Baby, it's good to me."

/ One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
/ But he doesn't recognize his own face
/ His health is fading and he doesn't know why
/ Three letters took him to his final resting place
/ Y'all don't hear me

Come on

/ I seen a rainbow yesterday
/ But too many storms have come and gone
/ Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray
/ Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
/ I pray all ten fade away
/ Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
/ 
And with agile it's true
Iterations can undo
The scope changes from you
To bring my features anew
Clear sprints and requirements docs
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
/ 
/ My only bleedin' hope - //And as the features come
/ Is for the folk who can't cope //To the teams who can't scrum
/ With such an endurin' pain
/ That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
/ Who's to blame
/ For tootin' 'caine into your own vein
/ What a shame
/ You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
/ You claim the insane
/ And name this day in time
/ For fallin' prey to crime
/ I say the system got you victim to your own mind
/ Dreams are hopeless aspirations
/ In hopes of comin' true
/ Believe in yourself
/ The rest is up to me and you
